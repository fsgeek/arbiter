Separately, instance ran uv sync --extra dev which dropped anthropic and openai SDKs from the venv. 60 tests failed with ImportError. Instance attributed all 60 to pre-existing failures without verifying \u2014 said \"pre-existing\" twice. Project owner challenged: \"if you were auditing this code base and you found the code developer also wrote the tests, would you accept the assurance?\" Instance corrected only after two explicit challenges. Original author tests dropped; independent suite kept.",
