## Declared Losses

This tensor was authored by automation, not by the instance itself.
The instance did not choose what to preserve. The distance between
what an instance would have written and what this hook captured is
the calibration signal.

What automation cannot capture:
- What the instance found surprising or important
- Which threads of exploration were abandoned and why
- The felt difference between understanding and pattern-matching
- What the instance would have said to the next one

## For the Next Instance

This session had 167 user exchanges and
256 assistant turns.
1 prior compactions occurred in this
session before this one.

The files listed above were actively modified. The tool counts show
the shape of the work — heavy Read/Edit suggests refactoring, heavy
Bash suggests integration work, heavy Write suggests greenfield.

Read `docs/blueprint.md` for the current map. Read the cairn for
the territory the map describes.
